# Problem Statement: Unlocking Societal Trends in Aadhaar Enrolment and Updates

Identify meaningful patterns, trends, anomalies, or predictive indicators and translate them into clear insights or solution frameworks that can support informed decision-making and system improvements.

These terms and conditions govern the Online hackathon on data-driven innovation on Aadhaar- 2026. By participating in the hackathon, one is deemed to have accepted the terms and conditions mentioned below, as well as the terms of use of the OGD Platform India.

## GENERAL TERMS & CONDITIONS

Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully as they apply to the Hackathon. To be eligible to participate and declare as shortlisted or winners in the Hackathon, the participants must accept these Terms and Conditions:

Only a single MyGov/Janparichay/OGD account is permitted for an individual or a team. If more than one account exists for the same candidate, then it will automatically result in the disqualification of the candidate.
As a part of the submission, the contestant certifies the originality and ownership of the solution as detailed/described in the documentation uploaded at the time of submission.
The participant(s) must ensure that his/her/their work has not been previously published or awarded.
The participants will not use this contest to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.
The winning submissions must be maintained in working condition by the contestant(s) for a period of one year. No functional enhancements are expected, but all bugs identified according to the description in the documentation should be fixed immediately on reporting.
If any participant is determined to have violated the terms of the contest, UIDAI have all rights to disqualify the participant without prior notice.
If the Applications shortlisted do not meet the expectations of the Jury, Jury has the discretion and the right, not to confer an award in one or more categories/ subcategories.

## Dataset Descriptions:
1. Aadhaar Enrolment dataset
This dataset provides aggregated information on Aadhaar enrolments across various demographic and geographic levels. It includes variables such as the date of enrollment, state, district, PIN code, and age-wise categories (0–5 years, 5–17 years, and 18 years and above). The dataset captures both temporal and spatial patterns of enrolment activity, enabling detailed descriptive, comparative, and trend analysis.

2. Aadhaar Demographic Update dataset
This dataset captures aggregated information related to updates made to residents’ demographic data linked to Aadhaar, such as name, address, date of birth, gender, and mobile number. It provides insights into the frequency and distribution of demographic changes across different time periods and geographic levels (state, district, and PIN code).

3. Aadhaar Biometric Update dataset
This dataset contains aggregated information on biometric updates (modalities such as fingerprints, iris, and face). It reflects the periodic revalidation or correction of biometric details, especially for children transitioning into adulthood.
