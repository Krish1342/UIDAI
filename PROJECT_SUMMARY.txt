UIDAI Project Summary

Purpose:
End-to-end pipeline to analyze Aadhaar enrolment and updates, quantify equity and demand across states, districts, and pincodes, and auto-generate a submission-ready report.

Data:
Large API exports across three domains (enrolment, demographic updates, biometric updates). Raw CSVs are partitioned in data/raw; combined and cleaned versions live in data/processed.

Preprocessing:
Notebooks standardize columns, convert dates, remove duplicates, validate pincodes, and export clean datasets (enrolment_clean.csv, demographic_clean.csv, biometric_clean.csv) for downstream analysis.

Analysis:
EDA summarizes totals, distributions, trends, and top geographies. District/state rollups reveal operational hotspots and gaps across age groups and time.

Equity:
Inequality measured via Gini; an Equity Score combines normalized activity with (1 − G). Pincode service levels are classified against district medians (severely underserved → well served) to flag intervention priorities.

Modeling:
Demand modeling (Random Forest) leverages geography, temporal, and age features to explain activity and inform resource allocation; performance and feature importance are summarized in the report.

Outputs:
Clean datasets, key insight CSVs (clusters, gini, equity, priority districts), visualizations, and a submission-ready PDF generated by scripts/generate_report.py.

Usage:
Install dependencies (requirements.txt), refresh cleaned data via notebooks if needed, then run the report generator to produce a comprehensive, reproducible analysis for decision-making.
